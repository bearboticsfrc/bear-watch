# Bear Watch

Bear Watch is a tool developed by Bearbotics to monitor the time spent by students and mentors at our facility.

## Configuring the Application
Open ``config.py`` in a text editor and modify ``SUBNETS`` to reflect the networks you want to scan.

You can also customize the other settings to suit your preferences.

## Running the Application

### Linux
To run the application on a Linux-based system, use the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Windows

For Windows-based systems, execute the script with:

```bash
.\run.sh
```

**Note:** Due to the nature of Nmap, elevated permissions are required to run these scripts.

### Using the Tool
Head to `http://localhost/` to see it running! The website is pretty self-explanatory.
