# Bear Watch

Bear Watch is a tool developed by Bearbotics to monitor the time spent by students and mentors at our facility.

## Running the Application

### Linux

To run the application on a Linux-based system, use the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Windows

For Windows-based systems, execute the script with:

```bash
.\run.sh
```

**Note:** Elevated permissions are required to run these scripts.

## Future Improvements

Currently, the application lacks a user-friendly method for extracting data from the database.
